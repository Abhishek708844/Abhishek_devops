 # 2. Merge Conflict Simulation and Resolution


🔴 Step 1: Switch to main and merge branch1

git checkout main
git merge branch1
✅ O/P (Expected):
Updating abc1234..1a2b3c4
Fast-forward
 project.txt | 1 +
✅ This will succeed if branch1 does not conflict with main.

🔴 Step 2: Push merged main

 git push origin main

🔴 Step 3: Merge branch2 (creates a conflict)

git merge branch2
⚠️ O/P (Expected Conflict):
Auto-merging project.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in project.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

🔴 Step 4: Resolve conflict
Edit the file project.txt, and change:

text
Copy code
<<<<<<< HEAD
User1: Added feature A
=======
User2: Added feature B
>>>>>>> branch2
To this (keeping both):

text
Copy code
User1: Added feature A
User2: Added feature B

🔴 Step 5: Stage, commit & push

git add project.txt
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict between branch1 and branch2"
git push origin main
✅ Now your main branch has both changes from branch1 and branch2, and the merge conflict is cleanly resolved.

 # 3. Git Rebase Practice
🔵 Step 4.1: Create feature-rebase and modify
git checkout -b feature-rebase
echo "Rebase feature: New logic" >> project.txt

🔵 Step 4.2: Commit the changes
git add project.txt
git commit -m "Rebase feature: Added new logic"

🔵 Step 4.3: Rebase onto main
git rebase main
O/P:
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/feature-rebase.

🔵 Step 4.4: Push to GitHub
git push origin feature-rebase
Or if already pushed and rebasing again:

git push origin feature-rebase --force

# 4. Undoing Changes with Git Revert
🟠 Step 5.1: View commit history
git log --oneline
O/P:
9f9e111 (HEAD -> main) Resolved merge conflict...
3c3b111 User2: Added feature B
1a2b3c4 User1: Added feature A
abc1234 Initial commit


🟠 Step 5.2: Revert the last commit
git revert 9f9e111
O/P:
[main 1f1f1f1] Revert "Resolved merge conflict..."

🟠 Step 5.3: Push the revert
git push origin main

# DevOps Experiment 5: FastAPI Dockerization
# Experiment 5: FastAPI Application Development and Dockerization

1. FastAPI Application Setup

Created a basic FastAPI application with the following structure:

fastapi-app/
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── models.py
│   └── schemas.py
├── requirements.txt
└── Dockerfile
#main.py:

python
from fastapi import FastAPI

from .schemas import MessageResponse


app = FastAPI(title="DevOps Experiment API")


@app.get("/", response_model=MessageResponse)

async def root():

   return {"message": "Welcome to DevOps Experiment API"}
    

@app.get("/health", response_model=MessageResponse)

async def health_check():

   return {"message": "API is healthy"}
    
    
#schemas.py:


python

from pydantic import BaseModel


class MessageResponse(BaseModel):

   message: str
    
#requirements.txt:

fastapi==0.95.2
uvicorn==0.22.0

2. Dockerization
Created a Dockerfile with multi-stage build for optimization:

#dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM python:3.9-slim as builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --user -r requirements.txt

# Runtime stage
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local
COPY ./app ./app

ENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]

3. Building and Running the Container
# Build the image
docker build -t fastapi-devops .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name fastapi-app fastapi-devops
Verification:

Accessed http://localhost/ and http://localhost/health in browser

Verified responses:

json
{"message":"Welcome to DevOps Experiment API"}
json
{"message":"API is healthy"}

![D5 (3)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5b100cf-ea50-4658-add2-ea9709fd1043)




# Using browser  http://localhost/health

![D5 (5)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5777f5e9-c8e2-4307-a747-08e10d0a61cb)

#NOTE
# Stop and remove the container (when done)
bash
docker stop fastapi-app
docker rm fastapi-app
Additional Verification

# You can verify the container is running with:
docker PS



# Check logs with:
docker logs fastapi-app


# Experiment 6: Automation Using GitHub Actions

# 1. Project Setup
Ensure you have:

A GitHub repository for your FastAPI app (fastapi-app)

Dockerfile (from Experiment 5)

GitHub account with Docker Hub credentials (for pushing images)

# 2. Create GitHub Actions Workflow
File Structure
fastapi-app/

bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow"
git push origin main

# 5. Monitor Workflow Execution
Go to GitHub → Actions tab.

Check the Docker Build and Push workflow.

Verify:

✅ Docker image is built.

✅ Tests pass.

✅ Image pushed to Docker Hub (on main branch push).

# 6. Expected Output
Successful Workflow Run:

✓ Docker image built: username/fastapi-devops:latest
✓ API tests passed
